	<h1>ASU Operations Management Review</h1>
	<h3>A non-profit project prepared by a small group of dedicated and developing scholars</h3>

	<p>Since the genesis of operations management (OM), scholars have addressed managerial topics, emphasizing the relevance of their studies. Such effort has positioned operations management as an academic field renowned for its connection to practice. Given the research direction, the academic community has flourished in terms of the number of scholars, the volume of research outputs, and the diversity of research themes.</p>

<p>While we appreciate advances in OM by previous contributors, we face another challenge today. The continuous development in OM has led to a flood of new knowledge, which cannot be easily handled by a single research entity. In addition, the field has also deepened the depth of new knowledge, making it much more time-consuming to internalize the new knowledge than previously. Furthermore, real-world problems are becoming more complex and emerging more rapidly. These new challenges increase the friction between stakeholders in the field of operations management.</p>

<p>The vision of ASU OM Review (AOR) is to channel new knowledge learned by PhD students to the stakeholders of OM. Extensive and constructive reviews by AOR assist peer researchers in navigating their research directions through the fresh eyes of AOR editors, especially in new research domains. In addition, reader-friendly and concise content of AOR eases the understanding of academic knowledge for practitioners, thus bridging the gap between practitioners and academic scholars.</p>

		<h1>Testimonials</h1>
		<blockquote><p>Understanding, creating, and communicating knowledge … three pillars of scholarship. This publication, prepared by a small group of dedicated and developing scholars, provides a concise and lucid view of 36 contributions to the operations management literature. It illustrates a creative approach to reinforce learning from the PhD seminar and to disseminate knowledge. I believe it will serve as a valuable resource to both researchers and practitioners. Enjoy! <em>Scott Webster - Professor @ASU.</em></p>
<p>This book provides a pleasant guide to the evolving field of research in Operations Management. It is timely – it incorporates most advanced research from premier research outlets. It is actionable – it highlights real-world examples and practical implications. It is delightful - advanced mathematical models have been deciphered in a reader-friendly way. A must read! <em>Professor Mei Li, Michigan State University.</em></p>
<p>The ASU Operations Management Review is an excellent compilation and summary of research publications covering emerging topics in operations management. I commend the group of doctoral students that initiated this excellent resource. Biannual updating of the book means that it stays relevant and topical. I highly recommend this book  as a “go to” and “must have” resource for doctoral students, researchers and practitioners that require quick understanding of the status of research and future research opportunities in OM. <em>Professor Adegoke Oke, PhD. CAPS Research Fellow, Arizona State University.</em></p>
<p>This is an excellent, interesting read. It’s a great idea on two levels: First, It helps the reader to quickly find and better understand relevant, cutting edge operations research articles, and second, the author interviews at the end are invaluable, allowing authors the rare opportunity to elaborate on what they have published, and help the reader to better understand what they have written. A great idea, flawlessly executed, and an excellent read. Bravo to the ASU Operations Management Review team! <em>Professor Zachary S. Rogers, PhD., Colorado State University.</em></p>
